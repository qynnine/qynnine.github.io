## Interpreter
There are two major approaches to implementing programming languages, compilers, and interpreters. So, what does an interpreter do?

Well, from the above picture, an interpreter is a box. It takes two inputs, your program and whatever data that you want to run the program on. And it produces the output directly. Meaning that it doesn't do any processing of the program before it executes it on the input, So you just write the program, and you invoke the interpreter on the data, and the program immediately begins running. 

And so, we can say that the interpreter is online, meaning it the work that it does is all part of running your program.

## Compiler
Now a compiler is structured differently. So, we can draw a picture here.
